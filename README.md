4deck port for ArchAssault


This was originally ported to the Arch Linux ARM Wilson repo. The Wilson repo has merged with ArchAssault due to there being overlap and similar goals. Moving my changes to github.

All original/upstream work done by Dr. Philip Polstra.

Taken from his Sourceforge page: http://sourceforge.net/projects/thedeck/
addon module that allows forensic investigation of USB devices.
