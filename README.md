Port is currently a WIP! 

4deck port for Arch Linux ARM Wilson Repo

This was originally ported to Arch Linux ARM Wilson repo. The Wilson repo is merging with BlackArch due to there being overlap and similar goals. Moving my changes to github.

All original/upstream work done by Dr. Philip Polstra.

Taken from his Sourceforge page: http://sourceforge.net/projects/thedeck/
addon module that allows forensic investigation of USB devices.
ToDo:
Finish port
